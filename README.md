# CS-350-R3340

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to create a low-level thermostat prototype that controls different componenets of a TI board. The program used the temperature sensor to get the room temperature which was then compared to a set-point. If the room temperature is less than the set point, the heater is to turn on so an LED turns on to indicate the heater should be on. The project would serve as a base for a smart theromostat that sends data over Wi-fi via the cloud.

## What did you do particularly well?
One thing I did well was I wrote working code quickly and improved it from good enough to my personal best really quickly. I tested as I went along which meant I didn't have to spend as much time as I used to on fixing errors I did not fully understand and trying to figure out what went wrong and where.

## Where could you improve?
My understanding of task schedulers is still very new, so I am unsure if my task scheduler was developed in the most optimal way. I also was unsure of the appropriate documentation for the task scheduler so I am sure there are things I did not include or could have done better. Also, I initally turned in a project that had the condition for the LED turning on swapped. If I had read through my logic out loud, I would have likely caught this error. I actually recognized the error while evaluating my project while writing this journal. 

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
In this class, I have learned a lot about microcontrollers, sensors, state machines, task schedulers, and processing data. I have also learned more about embedded C and how it differs from C in regards to a program meant for a desktop. These are all things that I can add to my metaphorical tool kit.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project really challenged me to find the familiarity in the unfamiliar. I had to really read through header files and documentation more than I have ever before to understand how to complete this project. While I was already doing this a bit before, I haven't had to to this extent. I can see this being really useful as I go through other courses.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I did my best to make my code simple, reduce redundancies, and make it modular. In the future, if I wanted to add or change features, I could change specific functions without having to do anything to other functions.
